Once you have the extension installed, you'll se there is a new tab in your developer tools called "⚛️ Profiler." You can change the settings to record an explanation of _why_ each component re-rerendered in in the recording.

You can also have it highlight the parts of the DOM that re-render while you're kicking the tires on your application. Go in to the settings for the profiler and select "Highlight updates when components render."

This will get your a fun green rectangle around anything that is going through a re-render as you interact with your application.

You can download the React Developer Tools for _most_ of the major browsers.
