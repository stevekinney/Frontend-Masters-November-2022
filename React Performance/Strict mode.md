`StrictMode` is a component that doesn't render anything in your UI, but it opts you in to warnings and notices about potential problems in your application.

When you're using strict mode in React 18 and later, React will _double render_ your components when running in development. This is why you might see `console.log`s executed twice (and why you can't rely on them to count the number of renders). If you _need_ to count renders, you probably want to consider using the developer tools or even just a `useEffect` hook so that you run this after the rendering phase and during the passive effects phase.
