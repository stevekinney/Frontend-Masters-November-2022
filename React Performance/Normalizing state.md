How you define the shape of the actual data structure the represents your state can have more of an impact than going to town memoizing componentsâ€”or, at the very least, in some cases, it makes it easier to even do that memoization in the first place.

1. Scanning through arrays takes time. Getting a key out of an object is way faster.
2. Could you refactor the shape of the state in order to make a more performant application?

### Workflow

- Take the orders application and optimize users by referencing a key for the user.
- **Exercise**: Have them update the products.
- Iterate over an array of keys for the list. (Using either products, orders, users, or tasks from the Packing List).
- **Exercise**: Have them do one of the others.
