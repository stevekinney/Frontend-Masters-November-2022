Consider this silly little game.

Typing in that little input field is _not_ a fun experience given that the `<ExpensiveComponent />` slows down rendering. Can you re-arrange the components to prevent `<ExpensiveComponent />` from rendering every time the input field's state changes?

You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/stevekinney/wordman/tree/pushing-state-down-exercise) and you want the `pushing-state-down-exercise. branch.

I'll see you over in the [solution](Pushing%20state%20down,%20a%20solution.md).
