1. **Make sure you're running the production build** (in production, at least). All of those helpful warnings and tooling make your application an order of magnitude slower. They're obviously helpful in developmentâ€”but, not so much in production.
2. Make sure you pushed your state down as much as reasonably possible. When we learned about [rendering in React](Rendering%20in%20React.md), we saw that a state change in the parent component causes each of its children to render as well. If you can make that state change happen as low in the component tree as possible, then you will obviously trigger the fewest re-renders.
3. Yes, use the [React Developer Tools](React%20Developer%20Tools.md) to figure out where the most expensive parts of those trees are and then memoize them accordingly using `memo` and `useMemo`.
