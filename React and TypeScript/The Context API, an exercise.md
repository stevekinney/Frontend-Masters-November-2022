Another exercise, another application. No workshop would be complete without a variation on a to-do list, am I right?

**Super duper important**: Make sure you checkout the `with-typescript` branchâ€”unless you want some practice porting a JavaScript application to React, which is probably also worth an exploration, it's just a bit off topic at this moment.

It's your turn to take this for a spin. But, you've got a fun twist that I totally didn't through in so that it's not me just rehashing the previous content when I show you the solution, you're going to do it with the `useState` hook.
