Okay, now it's your turn. It'll be a bit of a Choose Your Own Adventureâ„¢, because there are plenty of places to do the same thing.

- Add a action and the associated reducer logic for one of the other adjustments.
- Add the reducer logic and then an action for when a user clicks on one of the related colors or one of the saved colors. `ColorChangeSwatch` is a button just waiting for an `onClick` event handler.

I'll do the latter in the [solution](Typing%20actions%20and%20reducers,%20a%20solution.md).
