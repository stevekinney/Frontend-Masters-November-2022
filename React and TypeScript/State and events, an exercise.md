Consider this [application](https://github.com/stevekinney/inspirational-quotes/tree/with-filtering) and it's `with-filtering` branch.

- Replace the hard-coded state with data from the API and include the correct type for the array of quotes.
  - The form for changing the count and submitting the form is in the `<Quotes>` component.
  - You'll need to pass in the `count` as well as event handlers for `onChange` and `onSubmit`.
- Add the correct typing for the children in the `<Quotes />` component.
- Add the correct typing for the `onSubmit` event handler.

You can see the solution [here](State%20and%20events,%20a%20solution.md).
