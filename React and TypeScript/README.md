## Appendix: Bonus Content

There are some things that we probably won't get to in this workshop, but I'm including them as an expansion pack for you to explore.

### TypeScript

- [Types versus interfaces](Types%20versus%20interfaces.md)
- [Function overloads](Function%20overloads.md)

### Common component patterns
