The most obvious idea here is to use WebSockets.

Other ideas:

Use the navigator's geolocation to feed location updates.

- The Battery API
- The Clipboard API
- Page Visiblity API
- Mouse position
  - You could build a drawing app that follows the mouse position once it has been pressed down and the stops once it has been lifted up. (This might be a better candidate for the Redux observable section.)
