So, let's talk about the problem for a hot minute. If I look at—oh, let's say—this user:

```json
  {
    "id": "3",
    "title": "Calculate reduced regional frame",
    "user": {
      "realName": "Thor Odinson",
      "alterEgo": "Thor",
      "company": "Marvel",
      "id": "10",
      "skill": "Verbal and presentation",
      "title": "Investor Configuration Specialist"
    },
    "status": "Verifying"
  },
```

And then, I look at this user:

```json
{
  "realName": "Thor Odinson",
  "alterEgo": "Thor",
  "company": "Marvel",
  "id": "10",
  "skill": "Verbal and presentation",
  "title": "Investor Configuration Specialist"
}
```

I can't help but notice some similarities.
